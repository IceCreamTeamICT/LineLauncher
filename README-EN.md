# Line Launcher

The main warehouse of the `Line launcher`. Hereinafter referred to as *this launcher/launcher/Line/LMC/LLC*. This warehouse is only for a brief introduction to `LMC` and does not contain any code.

## Description
`Line Launcher` is a launcher for [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) : `Java Edition`. `LMC` performs functions such as Microsoft login, game download and installation. 
`LMC` is available in two versions, the `C#` version was developed by [Huangyu](https://github.com/tmdakm), and is available via the following [code repository](https://github.com/IceCreamTeamICT/LineLauncherCs/). Please note that the `C#` version is only compatible with `Windows`. If your system is not Windows but can run `WPF` applications, we kindly ask that you try compiling a special version and/or contact us.  
Another version has been developed by `PyQt5` and is being developed by [I_Love_Ei](https://github.iloveei), theoretically supporting all computers that can run `Python 3.12.6` (Upward compatibility). It has a [code repository](https://github.com.IloveEi/Line-Minecraft-Launcher/tree/RefactorByIloveEi) which can be found here, and it will be moved to IceCreamTeam's repositories.

## License
The `C#` version is subject to the same self-written licence as the majority of `IceCreamTeamICT` projects, while the `Python` version is licensed under the `Apache 2.0 licence`.
